                                                        with a win over the Griffons
                                                        The Islanders opened the regular season with an impressive 78-59
                                                        win over Outaouais. The victory was marred by the loss of
                                                        all-star Ana Mendez who was hurt on the opening tip-off and will

                                                        slack with four players scoring in double figures in a
                                                        well-balanced attack. Emily Dias led the way with 19 points
                                                        while Sofia Lytyvn-Male added 16 to the winning cause. Girlie
                                                        Owusu chipped in with 15 points and Natasha Hunt collected 10.
                                                        The Islanders are back in action this Sunday when they travel
                                                        downtown to play the Vieux-Montreal Spartiates.

                                                        It was a thrilling game at the Casgrain Centre on Friday night,
                                                        where the Islanders got their first league win against Edouard
                                                        Montpetit 82-79. The Islanders led for most of the game, until
                                                        the Lynx made a 3 pointer to send the game into overtime at 72
                                                        all. In overtime the Lynx scored first with a couple of
                                                        free-throws, but then the Islanders took control of the game out
                                                        scoring their opponent 10-7 to win the game 82-79.

                                                        Football head into the playoffs on a high
                                                        The regular season came to a close this past Saturday as the
                                                        Islanders travelled to CollÃ¨ge Beauce-Appalaches to claim
                                                        victory 47-7. Coming off a bye week, the Islanders did not
                                                        disappoint; taking control of the game from the beginning. The
                                                        Islanders offensive line was dominant leading to two touchdowns
                                                        from Elijah Williams. A punt return from Jacob Mattie had the
                                                        Isles off to the races.
                                                        The Islanders played confidently, running up the score with
                                                        touchdown after touchdown. Wide receiver Nicolas Veillette
                                                        reached the end zone as well as running back Junyong Ro. The
                                                        Islanders left the field for halftime having demonstrating solid
                                                        teamwork, agility and skill throughout the first half. With the
                                                        minimum 35 point lead at half, the rest of the game was played
                                                        with running time. Beauce was able to score a lone touchdown in
                                                        the last quarter, making the final score 47-7.

                                                        The defence had 5 sacks on the day to limit the Beauce offence
                                                        to a lone touchdown late in the fourth quarter. With the victory
                                                        the Isles will host the Sherbrooke Volontaires in the

                                                        The Lady Islander started off the day on fire with a big victory
                                                        against Bois de Boulogne in straight sets 25-21, 25-21 with key
                                                        serving by Dominique Simoneau, Sandra Kusy and Olivia Kusy. The
                                                        next matchup versus Ahuntsic had many fans in attendance and
                                                        heartfelt support from the college community. This gave the
                                                        Islanders the edge to win in three sets 25-20, 24-26, 15-9.

                                                        Unfortunately after such a great game and high intensity, back
                                                        to back games with a shortened lineup saw the Isles on the wrong
                                                        end on 2 set loss to Andre Grasset 25-17, 25-9. Injuries are
                                                        testing the depth of the bench. After losing key middle hitter
                                                        veteran Marisol Uriza to concussion, the Islanders also lost 4th
                                                        year veteran Shannon Rooney to an ankle injury. Another straight
                                                        set loss to St Lambert 25-18, 25-19 saw the team finished 2-2
                                                        which was good enough for 3rd place on the day which means they
                                                        will remain in Section 2 for the next tournament.

                                                        Dominique Simoneau led the team in almost every category 12

                                                        Kristina Del Paggio and Olivia Kusy had solid days, Del Paggio

                                                        aces. Other notable performances was Sandra Kusy with 4 aces,

                                                        It was a thrilling game at the Casgrain Centre on Friday night,

                                                        free-throws, but then the Islanders took control of the game out
                                                        scoring their opponent 10-7 to win the game 82-79.

                                                        Football head into the playoffs on a high
                                                        The regular season came to a close this past Saturday as the
                                                        Islanders travelled to CollÃ¨ge Beauce-Appalaches to claim
                                                        victory 47-7. Coming off a bye week, the Islanders did not
                                                        disappoint; taking control of the game from the beginning. The
                                                        Islanders offensive line was dominant leading to two touchdowns
                                                        from Elijah Williams. A punt return from Jacob Mattie had the
                                                        Isles off to the races.
                                                        The Islanders played confidently, running up the score with
                                                        touchdown after touchdown. Wide receiver Nicolas Veillette
                                                        reached the end zone as well as running back Junyong Ro. The
                                                        Islanders left the field for halftime having demonstrating solid
                                                        teamwork, agility and skill throughout the first half. With the
                                                        minimum 35 point lead at half, the rest of the game was played
                                                        with running time. Beauce was able to score a lone touchdown in
                                                        the last quarter, making the final score 47-7.

                                                        the last quarter, making the final score 47-7.

                                                        Islanders offensive line was dominant leading to two touchdowns
                                                        from Elijah Williams. A punt return from Jacob Mattie had the
                                                        Isles off to the races.
                                                        The Islanders played confidently, running up the score with
                                                        touchdown after touchdown. Wide receiver Nicolas Veillette
                                                        reached the end zone as well as running back Junyong Ro. The
                                                        Islanders left the field for halftime having demonstrating solid
                                                        teamwork, agility and skill throughout the first half. With the
                                                        minimum 35 point lead at half, the rest of the game was played
                                                        with running time. Beauce was able to score a lone touchdown in
                                                        the last quarter, making the final score 47-7.

                                                        The defence had 5 sacks on the day to limit the Beauce offence
                                                        to a lone touchdown late in the fourth quarter. With the victory
                                                        the Isles will host the Sherbrooke Volontaires in the
                                                        quarterfinals on Saturday November 2nd at 13h00. The Isles won
                                                        the regular season meeting 39-10.

                                                        It was a thrilling game at the Casgrain Centre on Friday night,

                                                        scoring their opponent 10-7 to win the game 82-79.

                                                        miss 2-4 weeks with an ankle injury. Her teammates picked up the
                                                        slack with four players scoring in double figures in a
                                                        well-balanced attack. Emily Dias led the way with 19 points
                                                        while Sofia Lytyvn-Male added 16 to the winning cause. Girlie
                                                        Owusu chipped in with 15 points and Natasha Hunt collected 10.
                                                        The Islanders are back in action this Sunday when they travel
                                                        downtown to play the Vieux-Montreal Spartiates.

                                                        Menâ€™s Basketball need overtime to down the Lynx
                                                        It was a thrilling game at the Casgrain Centre on Friday night,
                                                        where the Islanders got their first league win against Edouard
                                                        Montpetit 82-79. The Islanders led for most of the game, until
                                                        the Lynx made a 3 pointer to send the game into overtime at 72
                                                        all. In overtime the Lynx scored first with a couple of
                                                        free-throws, but then the Islanders took control of the game out
                                                        scoring their opponent 10-7 to win the game 82-79.
