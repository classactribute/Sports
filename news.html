                                                The Islanders opened the regular season with an impressive 78-59 win over Outaouais. The victory was marred by the loss of all-star Ana Mendez who was hurt on the opening tip-off and will miss 2-4 weeks with an ankle injury. Her teammates picked up the slack with four players scoring in double figures in a well-balanced attack. Emily Dias led the way with 19 points while Sofia Lytyvn-Male added 16 to the winning cause. Girlie Owusu chipped in with 15 points and Natasha Hunt collected 10. The Islanders are back in action this Sunday when they travel downtown to play the Vieux-Montreal Spartiates.

                                                Men’s Basketball need overtime to down the Lynx
                                                It was a thrilling game at the Casgrain Centre on Friday night, where the Islanders got their first league win against Edouard Montpetit 82-79. The Islanders led for most of the game, until the Lynx made a 3 pointer to send the game into overtime at 72 all. In overtime the Lynx scored first with a couple of free-throws, but then the Islanders took control of the game out scoring their opponent 10-7 to win the game 82-79.

                                                Football head into the playoffs on a high
                                                The regular season came to a close this past Saturday as the Islanders travelled to Collège Beauce-Appalaches to claim victory 47-7. Coming off a bye week, the Islanders did not disappoint; taking control of the game from the beginning. The Islanders offensive line was dominant leading to two touchdowns from Elijah Williams. A punt return from Jacob Mattie had the Isles off to the races.
                                                The Islanders played confidently, running up the score with touchdown after touchdown. Wide receiver Nicolas Veillette reached the end zone as well as running back Junyong Ro. The Islanders left the field for halftime having demonstrating solid teamwork, agility and skill throughout the first half. With the minimum 35 point lead at half, the rest of the game was played with running time. Beauce was able to score a lone touchdown in the last quarter, making the final score 47-7.

                                                The defence had 5 sacks on the day to limit the Beauce offence to a lone touchdown late in the fourth quarter. With the victory the Isles will host the Sherbrooke Volontaires in the quarterfinals on Saturday November 2nd at 13h00. The Isles won the regular season meeting 39-10.

                                                    The Lady Islander started off the day on fire with a big victory against Bois de Boulogne in straight sets 25-21, 25-21 with key serving by Dominique Simoneau, Sandra Kusy and Olivia Kusy. The next matchup versus Ahuntsic had many fans in attendance and heartfelt support from the college community. This gave the Islanders the edge to win in three sets 25-20, 24-26, 15-9.
                                                    
                                                    Unfortunately after such a great game and high intensity, back to back games with a shortened lineup saw the Isles on the wrong end on 2 set loss to Andre Grasset 25-17, 25-9. Injuries are testing the depth of the bench. After losing key middle hitter veteran Marisol Uriza to concussion, the Islanders also lost 4th year veteran Shannon Rooney to an ankle injury. Another straight set loss to St Lambert 25-18, 25-19 saw the team finished 2-2 which was good enough for 3rd place on the day which means they will remain in Section 2 for the next tournament.
                                                    
                                                    Dominique Simoneau led the team in almost every category 12 kills, 13 aces, 67 assists, +6 Serving and 31 digs. Rookies Kristina Del Paggio and Olivia Kusy had solid days, Del Paggio with 15 kills, 41 digs and 1.88 SRR, Kusy had 10 kills and 6 aces. Other notable performances was Sandra Kusy with 4 aces, 1.74 Serve Receive Ratio and 39 digs.

                                                Football head into the playoffs on a high
                                                The regular season came to a close this past Saturday as the Islanders travelled to Collège Beauce-Appalaches to claim victory 47-7. Coming off a bye week, the Islanders did not disappoint; taking control of the game from the beginning. The Islanders offensive line was dominant leading to two touchdowns from Elijah Williams. A punt return from Jacob Mattie had the Isles off to the races.
                                                The Islanders played confidently, running up the score with touchdown after touchdown. Wide receiver Nicolas Veillette reached the end zone as well as running back Junyong Ro. The Islanders left the field for halftime having demonstrating solid teamwork, agility and skill throughout the first half. With the minimum 35 point lead at half, the rest of the game was played with running time. Beauce was able to score a lone touchdown in the last quarter, making the final score 47-7.

                                                The defence had 5 sacks on the day to limit the Beauce offence to a lone touchdown late in the fourth quarter. With the victory the Isles will host the Sherbrooke Volontaires in the quarterfinals on Saturday November 2nd at 13h00. The Isles won the regular season meeting 39-10.

Her teammates picked up the slack with four players scoring in double figures in a well-balanced attack. Emily Dias led the way with 19 points while Sofia Lytyvn-Male added 16 to the winning cause. Girlie Owusu chipped in with 15 points and Natasha Hunt collected 10. The Islanders are back in action this Sunday when they travel downtown to play the Vieux-Montreal Spartiates.

In overtime the Lynx scored first with a couple of free-throws, but then the Islanders took control of the game out scoring their opponent 10-7 to win the game 82-79.

In overtime the Lynx scored first with a couple of free-throws, but then the Islanders took control of the game out scoring their opponent 10-7 to win the game 82-79.
